## what is this?
This is a server/social-network for sharing images. All posts are end to end encrypted, so you know exactly who is able to see your content.

## Private by default social networking
This project is designed to share images via a social network. All content is E2E encrypted. That means no one is able to read your messages except the recipients, not even the server operator.

-----------------

The social part is all configurable too, at a pretty granular level. So you can configure things like -- do you want to let your friends see who your other friends are? Or hide that info from everyone? In any case, you *get to choose* who can read that. Not even the server-operator is able to read that info, unless you allow them to.

This is a difference from traditional social networks, like *Instagram*, where the server can see all your data.
